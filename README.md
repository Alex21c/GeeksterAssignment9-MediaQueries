# GeeksterAssignment9-MediaQueries

Refreshing mornings with a Cup of freshly brewed Coffee and CSS Media Queries. Like Coffee can take shape in any container glass | mug | cup, the HTML content of a webpage can also occupy shape inside any device whether it's yours smartphone, tablet, laptop, or even printouts from a webpage. Earlier were the days, when developers used to have lots of different versions of the same webpage for different devices, and trust me there were lots of devices and lots of hard work required that time.
With the introduction of media queries[1] in css3 web development became musical and robust!

Geekster assigned me an Assignment to learn media queries via practical approach, and here are the glimpses of the assignment i have made, have a look at it with a cup of coffee and happy smile on yours face!
